# LangChain RAG Application

## Overview
This project is an advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** implemented using **LangChain**. It enhances document processing and retrieval by leveraging state-of-the-art **NLP** techniques and vector databases for efficient information retrieval. The application is built with **FastAPI** for seamless API interactions.

## Features
- **Efficient Document Processing:** Leverages LangChain to parse and process unstructured documents.
- **Advanced NLP Techniques:** Utilizes NLP for intelligent document understanding and query processing.
- **Vector Database Integration:** Stores and retrieves documents efficiently using a vector database.
- **FastAPI Integration:** Provides a scalable and lightweight API for interacting with the RAG model.
- **Customizable Pipeline:** Easily adaptable to various use cases such as knowledge retrieval, chatbots, and AI-assisted search.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** – Core programming language for development
- **LangChain** – Framework for building LLM applications
- **FastAPI** – API development for seamless interactions
- **Vector Database** – Efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings
- **NLP** – Natural Language Processing for intelligent search and retrieval

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langchain-rag-app.git
   cd langchain-rag-app
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
2. Query the RAG system by sending requests to the API endpoints.
